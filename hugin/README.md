# Hugin network files

* __student__: the student network described in [../slides/5-bayesian-networks.pdf](../slides/5-bayesian-networks.pdf), slide 17.

* __synthetic_v1__: a synthetic naive Bayes network with one class and two features. F1 and F2 are equally important for the Class. A third feature, F3, is marginally independent of all features and the Class.

* __synthetic_v2__: assignment 1 network.

* __synthetic_v3__: F1 is the most informative; F3 is independent of the Class. F4 is highly correlated with F1. F4 does not have a direct connection to Class; it's connected through F1.
